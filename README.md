# Thesis_Code
This repository contains the code and experiments conducted for my thesis work. It includes various scripts for data processing, exploratory data analysis, and deep learning models with explainable AI techniques.

1. TempChange Jupyter notebook analyzes European winter temperature changes from 1880 to 2014 relative to the 1850-1879 baseline. The notebook features a plot visualizing these temperature trends over time, offering insights into long-term climatic shifts. It is designed to provide a clear understanding of how winter temperatures in Europe have evolved, using historical data.

2. CorrAnalysis Jupyter notebook explores the correlation between autumn North Atlantic sea surface temperatures (SST) and winter European temperatures. The analysis investigates how changes in SST during the autumn months may influence or predict winter climate patterns across Europe. Through data visualization and statistical methods, the notebook provides insights into the relationship between oceanic conditions and seasonal temperature variations

3. DeepModel_1 notebook focuses on predicting warm and cold autumn North Atlantic sea surface temperatures (SST) using winter 2mT temperature data from Europe. The model leverages deep learning techniques to analyze the relationship between winter temperatures and autumn SST conditions. Additionally, the notebook implements Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) rules to identify the most relevant input areas, providing insights into which factors significantly influence the predictions.

3. DeepModel_2 notebook focuses on predicting warm and cold winter 2mT temperature from autumn North Atlantic sea surface temperatures (SST).
