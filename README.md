 **TempChange** Jupyter notebook analyzes European winter temperature changes from 1880 to 2014 relative to the 1850-1879 baseline. The notebook features a plot visualizing these temperature trends over time, offering insights into long-term climatic shifts. It is designed to provide a clear understanding of how winter temperatures in Europe have evolved, using historical data.
